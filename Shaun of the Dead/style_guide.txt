This is a style guide for naming parts of a Python application

There are a number of guides on the web that mostly agree with each other, this is taken from those with the arguing removed

Types of case:
snake_case: lower case with underscores between words
CamelCase: Words start in uppercase and proceed in lower case. Words are concatinated. Capitalize all letters of an abbreviation (e.g. HTTPServer)
FULLY_CAPITALIZED  Upper case with underscores between words

Useage:
Module and file names:- snake_case
Classes:- CamelCase
Variables:- snake_case
Method and functions:- snake_case
ConstantS: FULLY_CAPITALIZED
Folders: CamelCase 

There's more but this will do for now.
If you really want to lose your mind then the Python.org style guide is here:
